**Last Updated:** November 5, 2025  
**Status:** Active Development - Transitioning to Master Framework

## What This Project Is

This is the **MASTER FRAMEWORK** for QuantConnect algorithmic trading strategies. It serves as the central development environment where:

- **Modules are developed and tested** - Reusable trading components (entry signals, exit strategies, position sizing, risk management)
- **Strategies are experimented with** - Rapid testing of module combinations and new trading ideas
- **Performance analysis is conducted** - Professional benchmarking tools with real market data
- **Production strategies are derived** - Clean, focused strategies exported to separate repositories

## Master Framework Concept

### This Repository (Master Framework)
- **Purpose:** Development, experimentation, and module library
- **Content:** All modules, testing tools, performance analysis, strategy playground
- **Audience:** Development and research

### Production Projects (Derived Repositories)
- **SPY_EMA_Strategy** - Clean production deployment (future)
- **QQQ_Momentum_Strategy** - Additional strategies (future)
- **Multi_Asset_Strategy** - Portfolio strategies (future)

### Key Principles
- **One Strategy = One Asset:** Focused, single-asset production strategies
- **Module Reusability:** Build once, test across multiple strategies
- **Production Stability:** Production projects remain stable when master framework evolves
- **Controlled Updates:** Manual module updates to production with performance validation

## Current Capabilities

### Implemented Features
- **SPY EMA Crossover Strategy** - Working algorithm with proven Q3 2025 results
- **Professional Performance Analysis** - Color-coded comparison tables with buy & hold benchmarking
- **Real Market Data Integration** - 32+ years of SPY data from TradingView
- **Enhanced Backtest Workflow** - Automated deployment and analysis pipeline
- **Comprehensive Risk Metrics** - Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, volatility calculations

### Latest Performance (Q3 2025)
- **Strategy Return:** 8.13% vs **Buy & Hold:** 8.51%
- **Strategy Sharpe:** 2.601 vs **Buy & Hold:** 3.868
- **Analysis:** Buy & hold outperformed with better risk-adjusted returns

## Project Architecture

### Current Structure (Transitional)
- **Algorithm:** main.py with integrated buy & hold tracking
- **Performance Tools:** calculate_performance.py with color-coded tables
- **Data:** Real SPY market data (1993-2025)
- **Deployment:** Automated pipeline to QuantConnect cloud

### Future Structure (Master Framework)
- **Module Library:** Reusable entry/exit/sizing/risk components
- **Strategy Playground:** Rapid module combination testing
- **Export Tools:** Generate clean production strategies
- **Version Management:** Track module versions and performance impact
